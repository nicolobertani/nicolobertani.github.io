In this post you can find a step-by-step recipe to write posts in R Markdown and add them to your Jekyll website.


#### Premise

I am assuming that you are familiar with R(<https://www.r-project.org/>), RStudio(<https://rstudio.com>), R Markdown(<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>), Jekyll(<https://jekyllrb.com>), and Github pages(<https://pages.github.com>). I am also assuming you have already built your website using Jekyll.

All the steps I am going to be describing below distill to a brainlessly executable list what you can read in more detail in "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown" by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill (<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/jekyll.html>), and in Yihui Xie's post(<https://jekyll.yihui.org/2014/09/jekyll-with-knitr.html>), which discusses these resources: <https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll>.
I am just going to cut some corners and spell out a couple of steps that were not immediately clear to me, given that I am not familiar with the blogdown package, and I wanted to learn the bear minimum to start blogging.

If you have more time, I can you read more into this, or into any of the great resources that are freely available at <https://bookdown.org>.


#### The problem

I have built my personal website using Jekyll and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)(no knowledge of Bootstrap is required for this post), and I have hosted it on Github pages.
Next thing on my agenda is to create my first blog post.

I do most of my work in R, using RStudio. I use R Markdown extensively to produce short documents: for instance, reports to share with coauthors.
Since I expect most of my posts to feature some sort of R output, the most natural workflow I can think of is to write my post with R Markdown, have Jekyll generate my website, and then push the new version to Github.

I started looking for a step-by-step recipe that would explain how to do this rapidly and basically without requiring me to fire up any neurons, but I did not quite find it.
Therefore, producing this recipe seemed a good goal for my first post.
This is effectively a metapost: I learnt how to use R Markdown with Jekyll (and Github pages) in order to write this post on how to use R Markdown with Jekyll (and Github pages).


#### What is available

The R packages blogdown(<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/>) enables the creation of websites using R Markdown. It relies on the use of Hugo(<https://gohugo.io>) rather than Jekyll. I am not familiar with Hugo, but at first glance Hugo and Jekyll seem pretty interchangeable tools. Therefore, if you are starting a new website, you might want to consider bookdown compatibility. <https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/from-jekyll.html> describes how to migrate from Jekyll to Hugo.


#### Recipe

Since I do not wish to migrate now, in order to use R Markdown and Jekyll, you can follow the steps here below.
In true RStudio style, this turns out to be very easy and quite effective.
However, since the explanations in the references above address the case of, it is not immediately clear how to adapt the instructions when your website already exists.

##### Step 1
Launch RStudio (or R) and install the bookdown package[^1]. Load it to confirm proper installation.

{% highlight r %}
install.packages('bookdown')
library(bookdown)
{% endhighlight %}

[^1]: I used `install.packages` instead of `devtool::install_github` because it is more fail/fool-proof.

##### Step 2
Clone or download the repository <https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll>. From the terminal, if you have Git, this is easily done.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll.git
{% endhighlight %}
This will create a repository `blogdown-jekyll/` on your computer.

##### Step 3
Locate, in the `blogdown-jekyll/` repository, the script `blogdown-jekyll.Rproj` and the folder `R/`[^2]. Move this script and this folder to the repository where your existing Jekyll file is stored. For clarity, this would be the repository that contains the various `_posts`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_config.yml`, etc. of your website. You can now throw away the `blogdown-jekyll/` repository and rename `blogdown-jekyll.Rproj`, if you wish.

[^2]: This folder contains the scripts `build.R` and `build_one.R`.

##### Step 4
Open the `_config.yml` file for your existing website, and add the following lines:

{% highlight bash %}
markdown: kramdown
exclude: ['*.Rmd']
{% endhighlight %}
Save and close.

##### Step 5
Open the `blogdown-jekyll.Rproj` script. This should launch a new R Studio session with no script and just a few more tabs in the Enrivonment pane.

##### Step 6
In the console, run the following:

{% highlight r %}
file.edit('.Rprofile')
{% endhighlight %}
This will open a blank script named ".Rprofile". Add the following to the script, then save and close.

{% highlight r %}
options(
  blogdown.generator = 'jekyll',
  blogdown.method = 'custom',
  blogdown.subdir = '_posts',
  servr.daemon = TRUE
)
{% endhighlight %}
This assumes that your posts are in the default Jekyll directory `_posts/`. In case you changed this, you will need to modify `blogdown.subdir` accordingly.
Close the project, or quit R Studio.

##### You should be all set.
Check that everything is properly working by opening `blogdown-jekyll.Rproj`  and running `blogdown::serve_site()` in your console.
Your website should display in the Viewer pane of R Studio.
It will update as you make your changes (livereload).

You can now start working on your R Markdown posts.
Blogdown features the `blogdown::new_post()` function.
Alternatively, just creating a new R Markdown file from the menu will work just fine, as long as you save it in the directory of the blog posts (again Jekyll default is `_posts/`).

If you create a post while `blogdown::serve_site()` is not running, remember to run it before you push the new version of the website to Github.
Remember to close your project before you close R Studio.
