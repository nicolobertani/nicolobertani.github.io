I am currently pursuing my doctorate in [Decision Sciences](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/academic-areas/decision-sciences) at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/), under the supervision of [Enrico Diecidue](https://faculty.insead.edu/enrico-diecidue/home) and [Ville Satopää](https://faculty.insead.edu/ville-satopaa/home), with expected graduation in 2020-21.

I work on individual decision making and forecasting, particularly with high-dimensional (probability) models.
<!-- uses data and the study of individual decision making to understand and try to alleviate societal problems. -->
<!-- My research encompasses both the decision and the data analysis facets that compose decision sciences. -->
I value applications that can have societal upsides.
I am currently working on environmental decision making and urban crime forecasting.
<!-- This work has required methodological developments, particularly in the domain of high dimensional modeling, and experimental methods. -->
