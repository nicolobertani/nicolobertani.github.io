**THIS WEBSITE IS OBSOLETE. I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A COMPLETELY NEW VERSION USING HUGO, RMARKDOWN, AND ALL THE GOOD STUFF. HOPE TO HAVE IT UP SOON.**

**MY GITHUB PROFILE IS ALWAYS UP TO DATE.**

<!-- **MY UPDATED VITA IS AVAILABLE [HERE](https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/person/nicolo-bertani?parent-page=247).** -->



I am currently pursuing my doctorate in [Decision Sciences](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/academic-areas/decision-sciences) at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/), under the supervision of [Enrico Diecidue](https://faculty.insead.edu/enrico-diecidue/home) and [Ville Satopää](https://faculty.insead.edu/ville-satopaa/home), with expected graduation in 2020-21.

I work on individual decision making and forecasting, particularly with high-dimensional (probability) models.
<!-- uses data and the study of individual decision making to understand and try to alleviate societal problems. -->
<!-- My research encompasses both the decision and the data analysis facets that compose decision sciences. -->
I value applications that can have societal upsides.
I am currently working on environmental decision making and urban crime forecasting.
<!-- This work has required methodological developments, particularly in the domain of high dimensional modeling, and experimental methods. -->

#### On this website

On this website, you can find news and resources related to my [research](/research), in line with the principles of open research, which I fully support.
Someday, I will cultivate a more generic blog.
Meanwhile, I have made available some high performance implementations of Bayesian Machine Learning techniques (Bayesian variable selection via Spike-and-Slab, Gaussian Processes) on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username | escape }}).
The software is written in C++ and is meant for use in R via Rcpp and RcppArmadillo.
The latest additions to the website are listed below, for convenience.
